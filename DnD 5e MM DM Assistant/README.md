Meant for use by DM's as they game in combination with a copy of the DnD5e MM, allowing for a super simple way to look up any
Monster's page # based on their name in the 1st publication of the DnD5e Monster Manual. & an easy to use Challenge Rating
menu that allows for level scaling of Monsters/NPCs.

No association with WotC.
